# Chapter 4
Divide-and-Conquer:  

**Divide** the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.  
**Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the problem the subproblems in a straightforward manner.  
**Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solutions for the original problem.  
  
When the subproblems are large enough to solve recursively, we call that the **recursive-case**. Once the subproblems become small enough that we no longer recurse, we say the recursion "bottoms out" and that we have gotten down to the **base-case**.
