## The maximum-subarray problem

You are given an one dimensional array that may contain both positive and negative integers, find the sum of contiguous subarray of numbers which has the largest sum.  
For example, if the given array is {-2, -5, **6, -2, -3, 1, 5,** -6}, then the maximum subarray sum is 7 (see highlighted elements).  
  
The **naive** method is to run two loops. The outer loop picks the beginning element, the inner loop finds the maximum possible sum with first element picked by outer loop and compares this maximum with the overall maximum. Finally return the overall maximum. The time complexity of the naive method is O($n^2$).  
  
Using **Divide and Conquer** approach, we can find the maximum subarray sum in O($n\log(n)$) time. Following is the algorithm:  
1) Divide the given array in two halves  
2) Return the maximum of following three  
a) Maximum subarray sum in left half (Make recursive call)  
b) Maximum subarray sum in right half (Make a recursive call)  
c) Maximum subarray sum such that the subarray crosses the midpoint
